  <p> Season 10 competitor Jessica Clayton knows about the importance keeping a clear head and having a good workout or competition. “You have to have the mental capacity to push past the physical limitations. If you’re too afraid to even try something, that’s the biggest killer. You get to something and you look and you’re like, ‘I’m going to do what? I’m going to jump and hang, and I’m going to fall.’ If you can’t get past that in your head, you can’t even physically try the obstacles."

     Kacy Catanzaro (above) was the first woman to make it up the warped wall. Another strong female competitor, Jessie Graff, gave advice for tackling the cargo net (also above). She said "Get low, but throw your feet high and lean back. This would help you avoid a long climb down the net, but keep your feet out of the water."
